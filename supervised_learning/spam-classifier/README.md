# Spam Classifier

This project is a spam classifier implemented in Python. It uses machine learning techniques to classify text messages as spam or not spam.

## Project Structure

```
spam-classifier
├── src
│   └── main.py          # Main script for the spam classifier
├── data
│   └── dataset.csv      # Dataset for training and testing
├── nltk_data            # Optional directory for NLTK data files
├── requirements.txt      # Required Python libraries
└── README.md            # Project overview and instructions
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spam-classifier
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Classifier

To run the spam classifier, execute the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is located in the `data` directory. It should be in CSV format with the following columns:

- `text`: The text message to be classified.
- `label`: The corresponding label (spam or not spam).

## NLTK Data

If you are using NLTK for natural language processing tasks, you may need to download additional data files. Place them in the `nltk_data` directory.
